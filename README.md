# POSIX Timer usage in a multi threaded environment

Briefly, This is an example of a POSIX timer project. The code here is provided for reference purposes and may be helpful to new IPC (interprocess communications) programmers. You will need to make sure that you have posix_time.h from a package like linux-threads or pthreads or something like that for this to work. I haven't compiled this code for a while so I'm not sure what state it's in. However, I do, occasionally, look at this code for reference -Hope it helps.
